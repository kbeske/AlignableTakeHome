Alignable Front End Take-Home Test

If I had more time for this coding challenge, I would have added the task cards.
I would have made a separate component for a card so that I could then just
render a list of them in the main component.  The card component would
be in its own file so that I could organize the css better, instead of having
one huge .scss file.  For the card css I would have had a card class name to
control the formatting for all the cards, and then specific class names for each
category to display the right color bar at the top.  I would have done something
similar for urgent tasks to be shown in bold text.  I would write tests as I go,
in separate files for each component file.  I would have moved the task maker
into its own component too to make the overarching task manager component easier
to read.  I would make everything responsive according to the instructions and
diagrams, using the @media rule to control whent to display for mobile and
css-grid for formatting.  I would have figured out a good way to check for a
completed task when the user clicks the "create" button, and correct the button
formatting because it's not as wide as the other things in the task maker for
some reason.  I would also finish the tests for the reducer functions.
